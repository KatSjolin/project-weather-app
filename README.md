# Weather App

The assignment was to create a weather dashboard, using a weather API to fetch data like today's weather and a 4-day forecast.

## The problem

I tried to make this project with as little code as possible. At first I had a much longer html and also a long list of DOM selectors. I learned a lot on Stack overflow on how to shorten things. Working with branches for the first time was quite challenging but great to learn about too.
If I had more time I'd like to add more icons for different types of weather, instead of just cloudy, clear and rainy. I'd also like to add more cities to choose from.
